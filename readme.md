###General
Many of the item in my vim repo were taken from Jeffrey Way's <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/My-Vim-Repo/blob/master/vimrc" target="_blank">vimrc</a> file and from his <a hreaf='http://net.tutsplus.com/?s=venturing+into+vim' target='_blank'>tutorials</a>. I also used Derek Wyatt's <a href="http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/" target="_blank">vim tutorials</a> and <a href="http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/the-vimrc-file/my-vimrc-file/" target="_blank">vimrc</a> file.


###Note
The .vimrc file is usually store in your home directory, but my repo has it in the .vim/ folder. I use a symlink to make it work. If you want to have the same file structure as my repo, you can make a symlink by running the following command:
    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
I hope you enjoy.
