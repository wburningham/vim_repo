###General
Many of the item in my vim repo were taken from Jeffrey Way's <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/My-Vim-Repo/blob/master/vimrc">vimrc</a> file and from his tutorials


###Note
The .vimrc file is usually store in your home directory, but my repo has it in the .vim/ folder. I use a symlink to make it work. If you want to have the same file structure as my repo, you can make a symlink by running the following command:
	ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
